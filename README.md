# README - MIE243 – Dissection 1, Ball Bearing

## Project Overview

In this project for the MIE243 Mechanical Design course, we are tasked with designing a speed reduction gearbox based on an engineering specification. The design process involves creating a completely new gearbox from scratch, using a dissected ball bearing as a reference for conceptual design. Our design will be developed in SolidWorks and will be prepared for 3D printing and rapid prototyping.

## Objectives

1. **Practical Experience**: Handle and disassemble real components, mechanisms, and consumer products to understand their functionality.
2. **Drafting and Modeling Skills**: Practice drafting and CAD/SolidWorks modeling to create a complete conceptual design.
3. **Design Application**: Utilize the dissected parts to inform new design choices and develop a final design ready for prototyping.

## Project Details

### Design Challenge

You are to design a speed reduction gearbox that:
- **Is Fully 3D Printed**: All parts must be designed for FDM 3D printing.
- **Is a Kit Form**: The design must be easy to assemble without special tools and must fit within a reduced scale.
- **Has Specific Constraints**: The design must be assembled within 10 minutes and handle human-level external forces.

### Design Constraints

- **Shape and Form**: The gearbox design should be similar in shape to the dissected part but can include modifications such as cut-outs or an open-frame design to reduce printing time.
- **Support and Assembly**: The design must be fully self-supporting, with shafts extending at least 20mm from the gearbox. The input shaft must not exceed 3/8" (9.525mm) in diameter.
- **Component Use**: No external hardware will be used; all components must be printed. Temporary fastening methods may be used during assembly if needed.
- **Printing Time and Size**: The total printing time for all parts combined must not exceed 6 hours, and each part must fit within a build area of 155 x 170 mm.

### Design Specialization

Choose between two options:
1. **Right-Angle Gearbox**: Input and output shafts intersect at 90°. Target a speed ratio of at least 3:1 reduction. Optionally, include an offset between shafts.
2. **Parallel Gearbox**: Input and output shafts are parallel but not co-linear. Target a speed ratio of at least 12:1 reduction. Optionally, make the shafts co-linear.

### Deliverables

1. **Design Explanation and Justification**: A maximum 2-page document explaining your design choices, parts selection, and any trade-offs made. Include graphical communication to support your claims.
2. **SolidWorks Project Files**: Submit a complete SolidWorks assembly model in a ZIP file. Ensure the archive is self-contained for easy viewing and extraction.

### Important Notes

- **Printing and Collection**: You are responsible for submitting your design files for 3D printing and collecting the printed parts. Detailed submission instructions and deadlines are provided in the course materials.
- **Iterative Design**: Expect to iterate on your design. Submitting your first draft early allows time for adjustments and reprints.
- **Assembly Instructions**: Provide clear and detailed assembly instructions. Your design will be graded on ease of assembly and clarity.

## Conclusion

This project offers a valuable opportunity to apply mechanical design principles in a practical setting, from conceptualization to rapid prototyping. By following the provided guidelines and constraints, you will develop a functional gearbox design that demonstrates both your technical skills and your understanding of design for manufacturing.
